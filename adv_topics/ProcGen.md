# Procedural Generation advanced topic presentation outline
* Intro to procedural generation (5-10 minutes)
	* hook: Rogue, No Manâ€™s Sky, etc.
	* definition: Generating content algorithmically instead of through human labor, often using human made art and algorithms combined with machine computation and randomness.
	* use cases: Usually to create content in games or animated movies. Used for landscapes, characters, object, textures, level designs, animations, etc.
	* List off some games where this is used
	* Why procedural instead of manually designed?: Scope, Variety, etc.
* Genres of PCG algorithms (10 minutes)
	* intro: teleological vs. ontogenetic algorithms
	* chunk-based
	* perlin noise
	* separation steering 
	* cellular automata

		* Above source provides an overview of many algorithms and use cases
* How we will be using PCG algorithms (20-25 minutes)
	* cellular automata for generating cave-like levels
	* what type of algorithm this is and why we picked it
	* some talk about how to implement the algorithm (Useful: https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-7-cellular-automata/)
	* possibly include screenshots or pseudocode(big enough to read, not too much on a slide)
	* generated features (destructible walls/items/enemies)
